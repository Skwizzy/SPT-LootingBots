## Description ##
A server side mod that serves two main purposes for LootingBots. 

1. Marks all items with DiscardLimits as InsuranceDisabled. It then disables the DiscardLimit settings for the server via the EnableDiscardLimits option in Server/database/globals.json. SPT PMC bots by default spawn with loot already in their backpacks, this loot is not marked Found In Raid and thus is subject to BSG's RMT protection logic. With discard limits enabled, when a bot drops their backback to swap to a new one any loot with discard limits in their bag will be deleted immediately when the bag is dropped. To avoid this we set the EnableDiscardLimits to false, and also make sure to flag all items with a DiscardLimit >= 0 as InsuranceDisabled to prevent items suchs as keys and cases to be insured.

2. Provide the option to clear out the loot that PMC/Scav bots start with in their backpacks. This does not include meds, ammo, grenades ect. These options can be found in the `LootingBots-ServerMod/config/config.json`.
    - `pmcSpawnWithLoot` - When set to `true`, PMCs will spawn with loot in their bags/pockets (default SPT behavior)
    - `scavSpawnWithLoot` - When set to `true`, Scavs will spawn with loot in the bags/pockets (default SPT behavior)

        Default config: 
        ```
        {
            "pmcSpawnWithLoot": false,
            "scavSpawnWithLoot": true
        }
        ```
